                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Bachelor's thesis project focused on showing the capabilities of a digital twin
                    for robot programming and control. The project demonstrates how
                    simulator-based development can enhance robotics programming workflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development environment has been containerized with Docker to enhance portability.
                    The image is based on Ubuntu Noble Numbat, with a ROS2 Jazzy installation.
                    Gazebo Harmonic has been used for simulating the robot behaviors.
                    All the tests have been performed on the virtual model of the <i>SMARRtino</i> educational robot, based on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.marrtino.org/"><i>MARRtino</i> project</a> and provided by Robotics 3D.

                <h2>Content Details</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Introduction</b><br>
                    The main concepts are introduced, from the definition of a robot to the fundamental techniques used for its programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Development environment</b><br>
                    Further details about the used software tools are provided, along with the chosen configuration and conventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Open-Loop Control</b><br>
                    After a brief introduction to the main control theory concepts (with focus on the open-loop technique), the results of several motion control functions are shown.
                    This chapter aims to show the ease of implementation of an open-loop controller, along with its limitations.
                    The possibility to visualize data and plots resulting from each simulation highlights the potentialities of the offline robot programming technique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Closed-Loop Control</b><br>
                    In order to compensate the open-loop control limitations, the closed-loop one is introduced.
                    Other simulations are accordingly done, aiming for further precision.
                    Results are shown and compared with the ones previously obtained from the open-loop functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                    The advantages of using a simulated environment are repeated:
                    being able to easily visualize the robot behaviors and the related resulting data proves to be the winning point of the offline programming technique.
                    Further tools and potentialities provided by the simulator are mentioned, showing how could they be a valid starting point for solving more complex control problems.
